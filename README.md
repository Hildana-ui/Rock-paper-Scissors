# Rock–Paper–Scissors (Browser Console Version)

This is a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game written in JavaScript that runs entirely inside your browser's **Developer Console**.
You play by entering your choice, and the computer randomly picks one of its own. After each round, the winner is displayed in the console.
